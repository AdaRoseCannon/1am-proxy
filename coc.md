Code of Conduct
===============

## Social

Catch all: Don't be a gender non specific genitalia.

## Technical

Once I have cobbled some money for a wildcard subdomain
ssl cert this will no longer be an issue but for now:

 * No Appcache
 * Service worker - Scope it to your folder e.g. /~ada/
 * Local Storage - use sensible keys e.g. 'ada-access-time' rather than t
 * Cookies - Define path

TL;DR: Avoid interfering with the other user's too much.
