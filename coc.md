Code of Conduct
===============

#### Social
(Adapted from http://confcodeofconduct.com)

This hosting community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of members of the community or of the wider community in general, in any form. If in violation of this code of conduct we will remove you from the service.

#### Technical

Once we have cobbled some money for a wildcard subdomain
ssl cert these will no longer be an issue but for now:

 * No Appcache
 * Service worker - Scope it to your folder e.g. /~ada/
 * Local Storage - use sensible keys e.g. 'ada-access-time' rather than 'time'
 * Cookies - Define path
 * etc...

TL;DR: These are not likely to be an issue just play nice to avoid potentially interfering with the other user's too much.
